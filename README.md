# mocs
["Music On Console"](https://github.com/jonsafari/mocp) is great, but it can only sort songs alphabetically.
Here is a python ncurses gui that allows songs to be sorted.
  - a-z and z-a
  - size small-large and large-small
  - date modified old-new and new-old
  
  ## Installation
  download files to any folder <br>
  alias mocs="python path/to/sorter.py" #in .bashrc for convenience
  
  ## Usage
  1. open mocp and navigate to desired folder the quit mocp (but don't kill server)
  2. open mocs <br>
    - vertical arrow keys to scroll songs <br>
    - horizontal arrow keys to seek through song <br>
    - "enter" to play <br>
    - "space" to pause/unpause <br>
    - "s" to stop <br>
    - "m" to toggle through sort modes <br>
    - "esc" to exit program <br>
